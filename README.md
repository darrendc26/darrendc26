#  Hi, I'm Darren Da Costa  

 Rust & Solana Developer | DeFi Infra Engineer |  Web3 Security Enthusiast  

I’m passionate about building high-performance backend systems and DeFi infrastructure on **Solana** using **Rust**. My projects range from decentralized finance protocols (lending vaults, AMMs, CLMMs) to distributed systems (task queues, load balancers, key-value stores).  

I’m currently exploring **intent-based systems, anti-MEV protections, and high-performance infra for DeFi protocols**.
