👋 Hi, I'm Darren Da Costa

Backend & Systems Engineer | DeFi Infrastructure Developer | Web3 Security Enthusiast

I build high-performance backend systems and distributed infrastructure using Rust, Go, and TypeScript, with experience across both Web2 and Web3 environments.

My work spans:

⚡ Distributed systems (task queues, load balancers, storage engines)

🏗 Production-grade backend services (REST APIs, auth systems, transaction relayers)

⛓ DeFi protocols on Solana & Ethereum

🔐 Secure wallet systems, nonce management & transaction lifecycle handling

While I enjoy building DeFi infrastructure and exploring intent-based systems & MEV-aware protocol design, I am equally interested in backend, systems, and infrastructure engineering roles in both Web2 and Web3 companies.
